# LeetCode Daily Challenge Solutions

## Introduction

This repository documents my journey through LeetCode challenges. My goal is to solve and upload one problem per day, focusing on enhancing my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Objectives

- **Consistency:** Solving and uploading one problem daily.
- **Learning:** Improving algorithmic thinking and coding proficiency.
- **Documentation:** Keeping a detailed record of solutions and methodologies.

## Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Problem Analysis:** Carefully read and understand the problem requirements.
2. **Strategy Development:** Devise an efficient algorithm to solve the problem.
3. **Coding:** Implement the solution in Python.
4. **Testing:** Test the solution against a variety of test cases.
5. **Review and Reflection:** Analyze the solution for potential improvements and lessons learned.

## Repository Structure

- `ProblemName_Date.py`: Each Python file is named after the LeetCode problem and the date solved, e.g., `20231230_TwoSum.py`.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project and structure.
- `Progress_Tracker.md`: A markdown file where I track the problems solved, with links to the corresponding Python files.

## Progress Tracker

The `Progress_Tracker.md` file includes the list of problems solved, categorized by date and linked to their respective Python files in the repository for easy navigation.
